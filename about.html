                 <P>The world is changing and the rate of these changes is increasing day by day. The Internet is a huge
                    network made up of many smaller networks. It&#39;s used by lots of different people, like governments,
                    companies, schools, and individuals. Today, the Internet covers many aspects of our lives. Undoubtedly,
                    the Internet has become an integral part of human life. In a matter of very few years, the Internet
                    consolidated itself as a very powerful platform that has changed forever the way we do business, and the
                    way we communicate. The social web and mobile technology. These two innovations have changed the
                    way people use the Internet. In the social web people have found a new way to communicate. Just over a
                    year ago, we became fascinated by the idea of controlling the things through the Internet.</P>

                    <p>Men today is very busy. This has made life a little boring. Technology has come to help humans to make
                        life better and easier for them. One of these technologies that can be very useful in this field is the Internet
                        of Things. The Internet of Things (IoT) means objects that have sensors and can connect to the Internet.
                        These objects share data with other devices and systems. These things can be regular stuff you have at
                        home or fancy equipment used in factories. There are 7 billion internet-connected devices now, but it is
                        predicted that there will be 10 billion in 2020 and 22 billion in 2025. Oracle has partners who help with
                        their devices. In recent years, IoT has become a very important technology. We can now link things like
                        our kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats and baby monitors to the internet, making it easy for them to
                        communicate with people and each other.</p>
